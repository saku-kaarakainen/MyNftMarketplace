# MyNftMarketplace
Me trying to make my own nft market place. This repository contains the contracts and the [built website](https://saku-kaarakainen.github.io/MyNftMarketplace/).

I've deployed the contracts two times in the Ropsten network. So don't use real ETH.
Contracts that are currently in use.
 - [NFT Contract at Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xFEc8fE4d11D9Ab94915388326A074EEc3a79FbB6) 
 - [Marketplace Contract at Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xE507c2E385A62A14118A63B194b3Ae9AF2623d0F) 


Contracts deployed first time (They should be identical than original contracts)
 - [(old) NFT Contract at Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x145b9a4146f75ab5C2f76F4B038469786F7629f3) 
 - [(old) Marketplace Contract at Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x9AcFaD8f813f3b103D679522C7Fd05ab2D0f1B31)
