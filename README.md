# MyNftMarketplace
Me trying to make my own nft market place. This repository contains the contracts and the [built website](https://saku-kaarakainen.github.io/MyNftMarketplace/).

I've deployed the contracts two times in the Ropsten network. So don't use real ETH.
Contracts that are currently in use.
